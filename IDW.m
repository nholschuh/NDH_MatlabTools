%vc = variable values on the point [xc yc]
%x = interpolation points  x coordinates [vector]

%e = distance weight (negative value, larger in magnitude, the larger the

%r1 --- 'fr' = fixed radius ;  'ng' = neighbours
%r2 --- radius lenght if r1 == 'fr' / number of neighbours if  r1 =='ng'
%%% OUTPUTS
%Vint --- Matrix [length(y),length(x)] with interpolated  variable values
%%% EXAMPLES
%%% --> V_spa=IDW(x1,y1,v1,x,y,-2,'ng',length(x1));
