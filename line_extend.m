% This function linearly extrapolates to extend lines by a fixed distance
% or by a number of additional steps, given constant spacing in the current
% line.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The inputs are as follows:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% x - the x coordinates of the line
% y - the y coordinates of the line
% front_extend - either a distance, or a number of steps to extend at line
%               start
% back_extend - either a distance, or a number of steps to extend at line
%               end
% distance_or_steps - [0] for a fixed distance, 1 for steps out
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The outputs are as follows:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% x - The new x coordinates
% y - The new y coordinates
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
