% Computes the refractive focusing correction (in dB) for a given set of
% survey parameters using equation (3.8) from Bogorodsky (page 43)

% The inputs are as follows:
%
% H - Thickness of the first transmission medium
% h - Thickness of the second transmission medium
% v0 - Velocity of the first transmission medium
% v1 - Velocity of the second transmission medium
% p - Ray Parameter (horizontal slowness, or sin(theta)/v)
