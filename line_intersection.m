% Calculates the intersections between all input lines
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The inputs are as follows:
%
% lines - A cell array containing vertical [x y] vectors for the lines
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The outputs are as follows:
%
% intersect_mat - a matrix with flags indicating which lines intersect
% intersect_point - a cell array with the same size of intersect_mat
%                   indicating the precise coordinate of the intersection
% intersect_ind - a cell array with the same size of intersect_mat
%                 indicating the indecies that correspond to the 
%                 observations adjacent to the intersection
