% (C) Nick Holschuh - U. of Washington - 2018 (Nick.Holschuh@gmail.com)
% Designed to calculate the 360 or 180 degree bearing, with 0 = up the y
% axis (or north) and progressing clockwise
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The inputs are as follows:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% point1 - either supply origin points for vectors with terminii at point2
%          or supply a vector where bearings are computed progressively
% point2 - the terminii for vectors starting at point 1, or [empty] for
%          progressive bearing
% full_or_half_flag - [0] for 0-360 bearing, or 1 for 1-180 symmetric
%                     bearing
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The outputs are as follows:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% angle - the segment bearing
