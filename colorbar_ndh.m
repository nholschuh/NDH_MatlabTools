function colorbar_ndh(axis_label,nowidth_flag,width_frac,height_frac,bottom_top_frac,seperation_frac)
% (C) Nick Holschuh - Penn State University - 2017 (Nick.Holschuh@gmail.com)
% This plots a colorbar with adjusted width, spacing, and properties.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The inputs are as follows:
%
% axis_label - The Total Axis label plotted to the right of the bar
% nowidth_flag - If there should be no width adjustment to the original
%                   plot [1]
% width_frac - The fraction of the original colorbar width to plot
% height_frac - The fraction of the original height to plot
% bottom_top_frac - Vertical position along the figure for the colorbar to
%                   plot [0 - Bottom aligned up to 1 - Top aligned];
% seperation_frac - whether or not to separate the colorbar further by a
%                   fractional amount from the plot
%
