% Calculates the surface elevation and elevation for a picked horizon
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The inputs are as follows:
%
% elevation - Provide a vector with the flight elevations in meters (if
%       instead you provide a 0, it is assumed to be at the ice surface)
% surface - Provide a vector with either the pick index or twtt for the
%       target reflector. The code can intelligently identify which you've 
%       provided.
% pick - Provide a vector with either the pick index or twtt for the ice
%       surface. The code can intelligently identify which you've provided.
% time - vector that relates index to twtt
